                <p class="text-white text-xl font-nunito font-bold">Identifying a cloned website is difficult, but as a business owner, it is not something you can afford to ignore. It’s not usually the big brand websites that are targeted for cloning but smaller brands. It’s likely you will be unaware of the forgery until customers call you to complain about the service, or lack of service. </p>
                <p class="text-white text-xl font-nunito">
                    Cloning is not always used for criminal purposes. Sometimes competitors will set up a cloned website to steal material or search result rankings, essentially stealing business from you! Also, a competitor may clone your website and add content to deliberately reduce your brand reputation. <span class="text-golden font-bold font-roboto">What is Website Cloning?</span><span class="text-golden">As the term suggests, website cloning or forgery is where the offender creates a ‘clone’ website of the original. Most websites can be copied but there are counter measures that your web developer can employ to restrict the risk of cloning. The type of websites that are often cloned include e-commerce shopping sites, travel booking sites, and banks. The clone site can either look exactly like the original, or it may simply be similar in design and content. That’s were an expert investigator can assist with collecting evidence to prove that the similarity is not merely a coincidence. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works. It also addresses the takedown of websites which are operating to facilitate fraudulent activity.</span>
